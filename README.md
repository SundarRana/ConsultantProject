ConsultantProject
=================
This is a sample applicaiton I developed using Spring, Hibernate JPA, Twitter Bootstrap, MySql, and Maven. This is not a fully development applicaiton.
I developed just to sharpen my knowledge. 

I hope this projects can help other people and please let me know if this project can be optimized or can be integrated for more.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECTS:

This projects is based on a Consultant Management System. This application stores the Consultant's informations throught form submissions.
Also shows a way of log in to the applicaiton but it is not fully developed. It show the list of Consultants. Spring MVC has been used extensively
in the development process. I used Maven as a build, manage and deploy tool. Used Hibernate's JPA for data persistence in the MySql
database. Used Springs Resource Managed Transaction for Transaction with the database. Also used log4j for logging the application.
On the front side, I used JSP for rendering the view to the browser. I also used Twitter bootstrap to create response site. 


Finally, like I said this is not a fully developed application, you can take it further from here and let me know. I was working
on to create some restful web services as well as JMS and add Spring Security for the application but due to time scarsity I couldn't 
finish this. Please go ahead and you can add additional features. This project is intended for Intermediate level Java EE Developers.

Thanks!
